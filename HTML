            The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD.

        </h2>
        <p>
            Lying at the heart of Delhi, the majestic Red Fort stands as a testament to the architectural legacy of Mughals. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is built from fine red sandstone, and also famous as Qila-e-Mubaraq, is replete with beautiful palaces, pavilions and mosques.
            Not many know that the Red Fort also houses several military barracks raised by the British.

            Dating back to 1857, the barracks were built to house the British Army after it had dethroned Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor. Once British reign ended, the barracks were used to house Indian Army personnel, and were vacated in 2003.
            
            The barracks area is now being transformed into a dedicated cultural complex, and features four new museums: on the 1857 War of Independence, on the Jallianwala Bagh, on Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, and on the Navratnas - the nine masters of modern Indian art.
            
            Made in red and white sandstone, the barracks stand as fine specimens of colonial architecture and one is instantly drawn to their old world charm. Today, these barracks are being used as museums of art with the support of the Archaeological Survey of India.
            
            Apart from exploring the Red Fort’s interiors, tourists can also visit the shopping area called Chatta Chowk, which can be reached through the Lahore Gate, the main entrance gate of the fort. The market space is lined with stores selling ethnic handicrafts and apparel from different parts of the country.

         <p>
            The Qutub Minar, also spelled as Qutb Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms part of the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India.[4][5] It is one of the most visited tourist spots in the city, mostly built between 1199 and 1220.

            It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c.1190, which was constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage. In general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.

         <p>
            The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai, India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Ramchandani Road near Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Chowk.

            The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Saracenic style, incorporating elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.
            
            After its construction the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for important colonial personnel. The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with the lighting of the menorah, since 2003. There are five jetties located at the Gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry operations.
            
            The Gateway was the site of a terror attack in August 2003, when there was a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at its premises following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.
            
            In March 2019, the Maharashtra state government proposed a four-step plan to develop the location for the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the state governor in February 2019.
